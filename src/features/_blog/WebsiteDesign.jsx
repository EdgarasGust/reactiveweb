      <h3>Store Design</h3>
      <p>
        The creation of online stores is not only closely related to technical
        features but also to page design. I will develop a high-quality store
        design. In each case, the design is created based on the client`s needs.
        Some clients want to save and use a template, while others prefer a
        custom design. The most popular and our recommended option is an
        intermediate variant - individual template customization. In this case,
        the template is modified according to your needs by changing the layout,
        colors, font, and other elements. After all the changes, the store
        design differs little from a custom design but is a more cost-effective
        alternative. The design of the online store will be responsive to mobile
        devices and user-friendly.
