        Website Speed The speed of a website is crucial for its optimal
        performance. If your site operates slowly, it becomes challenging to
        achieve higher positions in Google`s organic search results. Factors
        such as large images, CSS, and JavaScript codes often limit page speed.
        While many visitors may browse your site using fast internet
        connections, and the site`s loading may go unnoticed, Google always
        takes notice. Depending on how your website was built, the size of
        images may vary. However, concerning product images in an online store,
        they are typically automatically resized to a predefined dimension.
        While this convenience is practical, it can lead to unnecessary website
        load and slow loading times. CSS and JavaScript are programming
        languages designed for website design. While complete avoidance may not
        be possible, it`s essential to use them judiciously. Visitor-Friendly
        Website How to make a website more user-friendly? The speed of an online
        store is critical for its success. If your website operates slowly,
        achieving higher positions in Google`s organic search results becomes
        challenging. Page speed is often restricted by large images on the site,
        as well as CSS and JavaScript codes. While many visitors may browse your
        site using fast internet connections, and the site`s loading may go
        unnoticed, Google always takes notice. Depending on how your website was

        It`s understandable that visitors also care about the speed of the
        website. However, as mentioned earlier, the difference may not always be
        noticeable. From the perspective of a store visitor, the most crucial
        aspect is the convenience within the site itself. Ensure that your
        online store is designed in a way that visitors don`t get lost. Here are
        a few tips on how to achieve that:
      </p>
      1. Feature main products prominently on the homepage, and make product
      categories easily accessible. If you have a large inventory, consider
      implementing product filters allowing users to refine their choices based
      on specific criteria. 2. Allow users to pay in cash upon product delivery.
      If possible, provide this payment option, as it builds trust with buyers.
      If you have the option to do so, it`s recommended. 3. Create a checkout
      window that is as straightforward as possible â€” do not request unnecessary
      information. Some fields that might help you but are not essential can be
      made optional. Customers will complete their orders more quickly if they
      do not have to register on the site. While it`s essential to gather
      customer profiles, consider creating a simple registration form, requiring
      only a password, in addition to the standard order form. Give customers
      the option to pay through online banking. This payment method is commonly
      used in online stores, but in some cases, customers need to log in to
      their internet banking, enter the store`s details, and only then make the
      payment. Understandably, we suggest avoiding this payment method, as it
      lengthens the payment process. The longer it is, the more likely it is
      that the visitor will leave for another online store.
