      <h3>Store Optimization</h3>
      <p>
        My created online store is optimized to become more visible on search
        engines. Store optimization includes page loading speed, keyword
        alignment, code compression, conversion of images into a
        website-friendly format, adaptation of the store to mobile devices, and
        other important changes related to store optimization. Search engines
        evaluate optimized websites much better, making the creation of an
        optimized online store exceptionally important for new e-commerce
        ventures to compete with well-established stores, which may not always
        be technically tidy.
