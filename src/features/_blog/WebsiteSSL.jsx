      <h3>Secure Online Store</h3>
      <p>
        All my created websites are secure. I will install an SSL certificate to
        ensure secure transactions in the digital space. During the creation of
        online stores, I only use safe and verified modules and source code. The
        content management system used to build the online store is also
        reliable and widely used worldwide. I am confident that my created
        online stores are secure, and therefore, I boldly provide a one-year
        warranty for my work.
